# Using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data to predict problem bacterial contaminants 

  

## Introduction: 

Burkholderia species are gram-negative bacteria and problematic industrial contaminants (Rushton et al. 2013).  Of particular concern is their danger as a pathogen to individuals with cystic fibrosis (Drevenik et al. 2010).  
To control all bacterial contamination preservatives are added to non-sterile products, but some species such as *Burkholderia contaminans* and *Burkholderia lata* display resistance to these (Halla et al. 2018 and 
Rushton et al. 2013).  Due to their potential resistance it is important to identify *B. contaminans* and *B. lata* and in this project we aim to develop a model that enables us to identify these problematic contaminants 
from the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value alone. 

  

## Technologies: 

To create and run this project the following technologies were used: 

* Python 3.12.0 

  

## To run: 

The following libraries will be needed to run the project: 

* pandas 

* seaborn 

* sklearn (import Logistic Regression and train_test_split) 

 
In addition, the following file will need to be downloaded for import (found in the zip file uploaded):
